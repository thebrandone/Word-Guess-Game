## Summary
This application was created as a way to learn and test my skills with Javascript. It is a Hangman game coded around key presses. Try to guess the letters in the word and see how many wins you can get!

## How-To
Press any key to start playing! If the key you pressed is a letter in the word, it will replace a blank and show up in the word! If not, your number of guesses will decrease and the letter will be added to the **Letters Already Guessed** section. Guess all the letters in the word to win! After you win it will appear in the **Wins** line and a new word will appear!

## Conclusion
This application was a good way to test my skills with Javascript. I found it very engaging to code around key presses, as that is a necessary feature for coding games.
